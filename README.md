Description

Upon entering a country, postalcode, housenumber and optionally an extension, you will get in return:
Streetname,
Cityname
Geolocation (Longitude and Latitude). 

In NL and LU you will receive the most detailed data. And fully free of charge.
It is covered worldwide for a broad geolocation.

This module is set-up to use multiple webservice-suppliers. Mostly one or some for each country, or as fallback Zippomoto for worldwide basic data. It is also possible to have a local database for known addresses, reducing API-calls and improving speed (still to implement).

Each supplier has it's own module and is being maintained by it's owner. Interfacing is the same for every supplier, the inner workings is upto them.
